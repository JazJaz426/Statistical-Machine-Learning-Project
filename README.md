# Statistical-Machine-Learning-Project

This is an inter-discipline project (statistics and nutrition), which aimed to investigate the complex relationship between micronutrients and dietary fat intake with obesity and lipid metabolism. 

As one of the statistics students, a series of scientific and feasible questions were formulated through the discussion with nutrition students. The questions were later reformulated as statistical questions by statistics students and a series of models were developed and assessed based on the given Australian health data.

## Statistical Questions:

Given our multi-pronged approach to the dataset, the statistical questions and hypothese were formulated.

## Data
Our data was Australian Health Data and proper data cleaning was performed, which includes correction for measurement error, excluding unrelevant variables, missing value handling, creating relevant variables through self-made formulas, etc. Also, colinearity and confounding effects were investigated as well.

## Models
Here we applied multiple different models. This includes logistic regression models with different penalizations, classfication tree model, Gaussian graphical model, Log-linear model, PCA, LDA and QDA. For each model, model assumptions were properly considered and limitations were carefully discussed. For all the models, we applied 10-fold cross validation.
