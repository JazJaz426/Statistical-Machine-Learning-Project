# Statistical-Machine-Learning-Project

This is an inter-discipline project (statistics and nutrition), which aimed to investigate the complex relationship between micronutrients and dietary fat intake with obesity and lipid metabolism. 

As one of the statistics students, a series of scientific and feasible questions were formulated through the discussion with nutrition students. The questions were later reformulated as statistical questions by statistics students and a series of models were developed and assessed based on the given Australian health data.
